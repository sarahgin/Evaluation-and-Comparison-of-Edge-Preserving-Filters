% Laplacian Filtering 
%   - public Matlab implementation for reproducibility
%   - about 30x slower than our single-thread C++ version
%
% These scripts implement edge-aware detail and tone manipulation as 
% described in Paris, Hasinoff, and Kautz, "Local Laplacian Filters:
% Edge-aware Image Processing with a Laplacian Pyramid", ACM 
% Transactions on Graphics (Proc. SIGGRAPH 2011), 30(4), 2011.
%
% The key scripts:
%   lapfilter_core.m  - the core algorithm
%   lapfilter.m       - wrapper defining our remapping functions, etc.
%   lapfilter_demo.m  - some examples, and scripts to generate 
%                       results in supplementary material
%
% Includes Laplacian pyramid routines adapted from Tom Mertens'
% Matlab implementation.
